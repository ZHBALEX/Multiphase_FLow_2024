Hi, this is mulitphase project 1 respo.

This project majorly studied the simulation of falling drop behaviour, breakup, and literature review.

The code used in the simulation could be found on https://www.multiphaseflowdns.com , using finite volume method, front tracking, was developed by professor Gretar Tryggvason.
The code has some minor modification in this project.
